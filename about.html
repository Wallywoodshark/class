        <h1> Why I Chose Animal Abuse</h1>

    As I was growing up the world seemed nice and pretty till a faithful day. I lived in New York for a time with my family (four years exactly) animals were a thing that most people did not have. A friend of mine had a pet bird and got his bird from a young folk that did not like the bird. When he first got him my friend saw that the bird never left its cage. When the bird was given to him the owner told him that he fed the bird once a week and changed the water every two weeks. When we tried to take the bird out he will always want to bite us. Although it was treated nicely it took a long time for the poor bird to get used to love and get comfy out of his cage
