  Animal abuse means cruelty towards animals that comes as infecting pain to the animals.
  Death, malnutrition, suffering, and harsh discipline are called Animal Abuse.
  Animals that are abused have been traumatized and will find everything really dangerous. "The animals whose abuse is most often reported are dogs, cats, horses, and livestock. Undercover investigations have revealed that animal abuse abounds in the factory farm industry. But because of the weak protections afforded to livestock under state cruelty laws, only the most shocking cases are reported, and few are ever prosecuted," (humanesociety)
